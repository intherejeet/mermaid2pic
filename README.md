# Mermaid Diagram to PDF Converter

This project provides a simple script to convert a Mermaid diagram definition file (`.mmd`) into a PDF document using a Docker container.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Docker:** The script relies on Docker to run the `minlag/mermaid-cli` image. You can find installation instructions for your operating system at [official Docker website](https://hub.docker.com/layers/minlag/mermaid-cli/10.3.1/images/sha256-4c6aa006e29f6da23acb854295d1395da99f2bba51048adbd93d978bb8bf0aca).

## Installation

1.  **Clone or Download:** Get a copy of this project on your local machine.
    ```bash
    # If using git
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd mermaid_to_pic
    ```
    Alternatively, download the project files (`converter.sh` and `diagram.mmd`) into a directory.

## Usage

1.  **Place your diagram:** Ensure your Mermaid diagram code is saved in a file named `diagram.mmd` in the same directory as the `converter.sh` script.
2.  **Run the script:** Open your terminal, navigate to the project directory, and execute the script:
    ```bash
    bash converter.sh
    ```
    *Note:* The script uses `sudo` to run the Docker command. You might be prompted for your administrator password.

3.  **Find the output:** Upon successful execution, a PDF file named `diagram.pdf` will be generated in the same directory.

## Files

*   `converter.sh`: The main script that runs the Docker container for conversion.
*   `diagram.mmd`: The input Mermaid diagram file (you should replace the example content with your own diagram).
*   `diagram.pdf`: The output PDF file generated by the script.
